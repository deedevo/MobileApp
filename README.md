Swift Application 

Hello everyone! That’s swift application for selling books, comics online. For making that mobile app I used many packages and frameworks such as Foundation, Firebase, SwiftUI, MapKit, Combine, UIKit. So, let’s look at more detailed on application by seeing frontend part and backend code.

1. Sign-Up and Log-In page 

For using that application firstly, you need pass registration or login (if you have account of course).

For storing emails and passwords I use Firebase. Before coding we should install all packages related to Firebase. Also, download the GoogleService-info. After we create login and signup pages, writing backend part. That’s it. Our registration part end. Let’s look at how this working in practice. 

•	I create account email= dias07@gmail.com, password = “Dias2004”. Password will automatically save in hash.

•	 How it is look in Firebase website. We see that in authentication we have email, User ID, and your singed in date.

2. After signup, you will direct on main page. As I said our app is about bookstore. By clicking item, you can buy book that you want.

3. One of the interesting libraries is MapKit. A map view display region. For example, in my case I show office location for users.

4. API. Also known as Application Programming Interface is a set of protocols and functions used in software to help interact with other software. For that I download JSON file, and fetch data.
